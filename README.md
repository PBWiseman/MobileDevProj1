<h1 align="center"> Pixel Fights </h1>

Pixel Fights is a simple 2d mobile game with turn-based combat. This game was made for a third year Bachelor of IT Mobile Game Development paper at Otago Polytechnic. It is intended to be a minimum viable product and was my first time making both a turn-based game and a mobile game. At the moment I do not intend to continue development on this game but that may change at some point. If you have any interest in developing additional content for the game, please get in touch!

## How to play

You can download the game on the [releases page](https://github.com/PBWiseman/Pixel-Fights/releases), or on [itch.io](https://pbwiseman.itch.io/pixel-fights).
You will need to manually upload the APK to your phone.
